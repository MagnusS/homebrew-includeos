# IncludeOS homebrew formulas

These formulas are currently experimental and rely on using conan for building IncludeOS.

To use them, add the IncludeOS tap and install `includeos`. This will install
Clang 6, Conan, Python3 and other dependencies required to get started with
IncludeOS.

```bash

$ brew tap includeos/includeos
...
$ brew install includeos
```
